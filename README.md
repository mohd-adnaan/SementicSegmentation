# Semantic Segmentation with SegFormer

This repository contains a notebook where I fine-tuned the `SegFormerForSemanticSegmentation` model on a custom semantic segmentation dataset called RUGD. The objective of the model is to assign a specific label to each pixel in an image from a predefined list of classes.

The model is initialized with weights pre-trained on the ImageNet-1k dataset and further fine-tuned along with the decoder head, which begins with randomly initialized weights.
